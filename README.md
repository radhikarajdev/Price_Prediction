# Deep Learning for Real Estate Price Prediction  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a guided project from Coursera: **Deep Learning for Real Estate Price Prediction**. The project applies machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices based on key property features.  

## Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using deep learning to estimate real estate prices. By analyzing various property features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and amenities, we aim to create an accurate and robust prediction model.  

## Features Used  

- **Square Footage**  
- **Number of Bedrooms**  
- **Number of Bathrooms**  
- **Swimming Pools**  
- **View**  
- **Basement Square Footage**  
- **Roof Type**  

## Key Steps in the Notebook  

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing data  
   - Normalizing and scaling features  
   - One-hot encoding categorical variables  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Implementing a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras  
   - Using features as inputs to predict property prices  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Analyzing performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared  
   - Visualizing predictions versus actual prices  

4. **Insights and Improvements**  
   - Interpreting model performance  
   - Suggestions for improving accuracy  

## Prerequisites  

To run this project, you will need the following:  
- Python (>= 3.7)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- TensorFlow/Keras
